# Optimized SDN Attack Detection Dataset (InSDN2020)

## Overview

The **InSDN2020** dataset is a carefully curated collection of labeled network traffic data for **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** environments, aimed at facilitating research in intrusion detection and network security using machine learning techniques.

This dataset focuses on **multiclass classification** of network traffic into normal and various attack categories. It features optimized subsets of attributes selected through a hybrid evolutionary feature selection approach to improve model efficiency and performance.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset consists of **three CSV files**:

- **`metasploitable.csv`**: Traffic data generated from SDN environments using Metasploitable vulnerable systems, including both attack and normal traffic instances.  
- **`ovs.csv`**: Traffic captured from SDN setups utilizing Open vSwitch (OVS), containing normal and attack traffic flows.  
- **`normal.csv`**: Baseline dataset consisting solely of normal SDN traffic for comparison and binary classification experiments.

Each file contains rows representing individual network traffic flows and columns representing selected features plus a class label.

## Feature Selection Methodology

To enhance classification accuracy and reduce model complexity, a two-step evolutionary feature selection process was applied:

1. **Modified BAT Algorithm:**  
   - An optimization technique inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats.  
   - This version incorporates a **weighted fitness function based on Mutual Information** to select the most relevant features that provide high information gain with respect to the target class.

2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA) Refinement:**  
   - The feature subset obtained from the BAT algorithm is further refined using a Genetic Algorithm to eliminate redundancy and improve overall feature quality.

This hybrid approach ensures the selection of an optimal and compact feature set that maximizes classifier performance.
