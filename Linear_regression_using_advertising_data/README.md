# Lab Task 06 - Multivariate Data Analysis

## 📌 Objective

This lab task focuses on analyzing and visualizing a multivariate dataset with numeric features. The primary goal is to explore the data distribution, identify patterns, and optionally apply preprocessing or modeling techniques (e.g., normalization, clustering, or regression).

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset contains multiple rows and columns with continuous numeric values. Each row is an observation and each column represents a distinct feature. 

### Sample (first few rows):

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Feature 4 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 143.63    | 35.68     | 7.57      | 14.01     |
| 287.67    | 13.36     | 27.56     | 18.22     |
| 232.99    | 16.46     | 17.63     | 16.49     |
