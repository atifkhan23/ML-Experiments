# Data Analysis and Churn Prediction

## üìÇ Project Description

This project consists of two main datasets:

1. **California Housing Dataset**  
   Contains housing statistics from California including median income, location, number of rooms, and proximity to the ocean. The goal is to perform data cleaning, EDA, and predictive modeling on housing value.

2. **Customer Churn Dataset**  
   Telecom customer dataset used to identify factors influencing customer churn. Includes demographic data, service usage, contract type, payment methods, and churn reason.

## üìå Tasks Overview

### 1. California Housing Analysis
- Handle missing values (e.g. `total_bedrooms`)
- Visualize geographical and income distribution
- Model housing prices using regression (Linear, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc.)
- Evaluate with metrics like RMSE and R¬≤

### 2. Customer Churn Analysis
- Handle missing categorical values (e.g. `Internet Type`, `Churn Reason`)
- Perform one-hot encoding on categorical columns
- Classify churn status using classification models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
